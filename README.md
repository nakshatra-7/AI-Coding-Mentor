AI Code Mentor - DeepDiff & Tree-Sitter Integration

This document explains how to use the enhanced code analysis features using deepdiff and tree-sitter in the AI Code Mentor project.

1. Code Comparison with DeepDiff
Purpose: Compare two code snippets and identify differences
Endpoint: POST /compare
Input: JSON with original_code and modified_code
Output: Detailed comparison analysis
2. Code Structure Analysis
Purpose: Analyze code quality and structure
Endpoint: POST /analyze
Input: JSON with code
Output: Comprehensive code metrics
3. Improvement Suggestions
Purpose: Get suggestions for code improvements
Endpoint: POST /improve
Input: JSON with original_code and modified_code
Output: Analysis and improvement suggestions
üìä Analysis Metrics
The code analyzer provides the following metrics:

Basic Metrics
Total Lines: Total number of lines in the code
Non-empty Lines: Lines with actual content
Function Count: Number of function definitions
Class Count: Number of class definitions
Import Count: Number of import statements
Comment Count: Number of comment lines

üîß Usage Examples
1. Compare Code Snippets
import requests

# Compare two code versions
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/compare", json={
    "original_code": """
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
""",
    "modified_code": """
def add(a, b):
    # Add validation
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("a must be a number")
    return a + b
"""
})

print(response.json())
2. Analyze Code Structure
import requests

# Analyze code quality
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/analyze", json={
    "code": """
import os

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
    
    def add(self, a, b):
        result = a + b
        self.history.append(result)
        return result
"""
})

print(response.json())
3. Get Improvement Suggestions
import requests

# Get improvement suggestions
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/improve", json={
    "original_code": "original code here",
    "modified_code": "improved code here"
})

print(response.json())
üß™ Testing
Run the test script to see all features in action:

cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python test_analysis.py
üìà Benefits
DeepDiff Benefits
Precise Comparison: Identifies exact differences between code versions
Change Tracking: Tracks additions, removals, and modifications
Structured Output: Provides organized comparison results
Error Handling: Graceful handling of comparison errors
Tree-Sitter Inspired Analysis
Code Structure: Understands code organization
Quality Metrics: Provides quantitative quality measures
Complexity Analysis: Identifies potential complexity issues
Best Practices: Suggests improvements based on metrics
üîÆ Future Enhancements
Planned Features
Language-Specific Parsing: Full tree-sitter grammar support for multiple languages
AST Analysis: Deep analysis of Abstract Syntax Trees
Code Smell Detection: Identify common code smells and anti-patterns
Performance Analysis: Analyze code performance characteristics
Security Analysis: Identify potential security vulnerabilities
Advanced Tree-Sitter Integration
# Future implementation with full tree-sitter support
from tree_sitter import Language, Parser

# Build language grammars
Language.build_library(
    'build/my-languages.so',
    [
        'vendor/tree-sitter-python',
        'vendor/tree-sitter-javascript',
        'vendor/tree-sitter-java'
    ]
)

# Use for advanced parsing
PY_LANGUAGE = Language('build/my-languages.so', 'python')
parser = Parser()
parser.set_language(PY_LANGUAGE)
